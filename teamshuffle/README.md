TeamShuffle
===========


Plugin
------
This plugin allows players to vote for a team shuffle during readyup. Each team can type "<b>/teamshuffle</b>" to 'vote' for it, after which it will do a swap (the biggest possible).
It not enough players are in the teams, the spectators are used to build teams aswell.

Admins can type "<b>/forceteamshuffle</b>" to do this without voting (requires CHEAT flag).
