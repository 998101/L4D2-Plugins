============

Various Left 4 Dead 2 plugins of varying purpose.

Competitive enhancement, bug/glitch fixes, general purpose and freaky-fun plugins.

Plugins:
--------
<b>ai_damagefix</b>: makes bot SI take damage like humans would (skeet/level fix).<br />
<b>damage_bonus_flexible</b>: flexibly configurable version of CanadaRox's damage bonus scoring.<br />
<b>ff_report</b>: friendly fire reporting (like survivor MVP, but FF-specific).<br />
<b>penalty_bonus</b>: bonus system for giving survivors bonus regardless of whether they survive or wipe.<br />
<b>saferoom_detect</b>: precise detection system for detecting whether players or entitites are in a saferoom.<br />
<b>saferoom_item_remove</b>: removes items from saferooms (uses saferoom_detect).<br />
<b>survivor_mvp</b>: MVP tracking and reporting (who did the most damage to SI, killed most common, etc).<br />
<b>vanilla_cvars</b>: allows server admins to set cvars for their vanilla game without it conflicting with confogl configs.<br />

<b>skill_detect</b>: WIP: detecting and global forwards for skeets, levels, crowns, tongue cuts, etc.<br />
<b>stats</b>: WIP: replacement and vast improvement of survivor_mvp; uses skill_detect.<br />
