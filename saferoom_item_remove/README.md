Saferoom Item Remove
====================

Removes any items it finds in a saferoom.

The sm_safeitemkill_saferoom cvar controls which saferooms are emptied:
1 (default) = only end saferoom
2 = only start saferoom
3 = both

This plugin requires l4d2_saferoom_detect. It will work even when l4d2lib's check doesn't,
though then it won't work for obscure custom campaigns.
