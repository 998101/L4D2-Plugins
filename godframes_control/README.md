Godframes Control
=================
Alternative version with godframes color indication.

Plugin
------
This is Stabbath's l4d2_godframes_control, and works practically the same still.
No cvars have been changed.

The only change is that survivors will glow red and become (partially) transparent
when they are godframed, so it's easy to see when you can't do damage to them.

To use, set:
<pre>
    gfc_godframe_glows 1
</pre>
